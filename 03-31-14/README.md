Intro to HTML and absolute basics of web development. Routing & Forms in Flask.

## Some Notes

HTML is the language of the web.
    - Everything you see on a webpage is dictated by its html.

Input Output makes web interesting.

Input on the web is an HTTP Request - Think of this as the URL that you visit + some additional data.
Output on the web is an HTTP Response - Think of this as the HTML that is returned.

HTML is a markup language. It cannot do I/O by itself.

Flask is a web framework which lets us do I/O (it takes in an HTTP request and returns an HTTP Response).

Im going to build a URL shortener.
    - It will take a long URL and return a short version.
    - If you visit the short version, it will redirect you to the long URL.

### Project Ideas

Writing a clone of the URL shortener I wrote.
Write a simple version of Nextbus. Check out the [Rutgers Nextbus APIs](http://api.rutgers.edu/) for information on how to do this.
You can write a "food delivery system" - an application that writes your food orders to a file, and lets you view them on a different page.

Install Flask - easy on Linux/Mac, harder on Windows but doable.

### Learn Python

My recommendation for learning the basics of Python (if you already have some programming experience) - Solve the first 5-10 problems on [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems) in Python. Register an account and you can check the answers that you get.

Also check out [Learn Python in Y minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/).

There are plenty of other resources on the web, but you must write code to get a good grasp of these concepts.
